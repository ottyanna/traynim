    HitRecord* = object

        ## An object holding information about a ray-shape intersection.
        ##
        ## The parameters defined in this are the following:
        ## -   `worldPoint`: a `Point` object holding the world coordinates of the hit point
        ## -   `normal`: a `Normal` object holding the orientation of the normal to the surface where the hit happened
        ## -   `surfacePoint`: a `Vec2d` object holding the position of the hit point on the surface of the object
        ## -   `t`: a floating-point value specifying the distance from the origin of the ray where the hit happened
        ## -   `ray`: the ray that hit the surface

        worldPoint*: Point
        normal*: Normal
        surfacePoint*: Vec2d
        t*: float
